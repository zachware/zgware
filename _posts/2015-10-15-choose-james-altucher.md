I read this book in a "find yourself" period. It's good. Not great.<!--more-->

Dec 2015

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-James-Altucher/dp/1490313370/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457188443&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=choose+yourself">Amazon Link</a>

<strong>Kindle Highlights:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>I’ll tell you the answer: ZERO sectors in the economy are moving toward more full-time workers. Everything is either being cut back, moved toward outsourcing out of the country, or hiring temp workers. And this goes not just for low-paid industrial workers, but middle managers, computer programmers, accountants, lawyers, and even senior executives.<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=256">Location: 256</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>This is about a new phase in history where art, science, business, and spirit will join together, both externally and internally, in the pursuit of true wealth.<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=270">Location: 270</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>So he started his own publishing company, in effect, simply to publish his next book. It was called Hilarity Ensues, and he took 80 percent of the revenues instead of just the 15 percent that publishers normally give. He chose himself and ended up making three times the money after all his costs.<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=279">Location: 279</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If your body is sick, if you are around negative people who bring you down, if your idea muscle has not been refined into the perfect machine, and if spiritually you haven’t developed a sense of gratitude and surrender, you will have less chances of success in the new Choose Yourself era.<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=290">Location: 290</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The only truly safe thing you can do is to try over and over again. To go for it, to get rejected, to repeat, to strive, to wish. Without rejection there is no frontier, there is no passion, and there is no magic.<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=345">Location: 345</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Only think about the people you enjoy. Only read the books you enjoy, that make you happy to be human. Only go to the events that actually make you laugh or fall in love. Only deal with the people who love you back, who are winners and want you to win too.<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=467">Location: 467</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Eating a turkey sandwich in a diner by myself on Thanksgiving Day 2008, I said, “Fuck it.” I was done.<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=470">Location: 470</a></li>

<ul>
	<li>Ninety-nine percent of meetings don’t turn into money.<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=475">Location: 475</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Every time you say yes to something you don’t want to do, this will happen: you will resent people, you will do a bad job, you will have less energy for the things you were doing a good job on, you will make less money, and yet another small percentage of your life will be used up, burned up, a smoke signal to the future saying, “I did it again.”<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=477">Location: 477</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The only real fire to cultivate is the fire inside of you. Nothing external will cultivate it. The greater your internal fire is, the more people will want it. They will smoke every drug lit by your fire. They will try to ignite their own fires. They will try to light up their own dark caves. The universe will bend to you.<a href="//book?action=open&amp;asin=B00CO8D3G4&amp;location=480">Location: 480</a><span>☐</span></li>
