Last week my good friend Peter posted <a href="http://www.slowhustle.com/navigating-major-shifts-life-zach-ware/">an interview with me on his epic podcast Slow Hustle</a>. I was his first guest last year and came back for a round two. As a rule I don’t listen to my own interviews so let me know what you think.

I randomly met Peter 3–4 years ago in Omaha. The only other thing I did that weekend was lay in a misshapen Best Western bed getting over food poisoning. We’ve been friends since.
