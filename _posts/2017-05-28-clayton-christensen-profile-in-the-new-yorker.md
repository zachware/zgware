The New Yorker <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/14/when-giants-fail">has a great profile of Clayton Christensen</a>, author of The Innovator's Dillemma. I'm not sure when it came out, like many things it may have been sitting in my Instapaper queue for a long time.

It's long. I read it over a solo dinner recently. Christensen is a fascinating human, full of contradictions. I particularly loved two things.

First, this bit.

<blockquote>But Christensen was a man of function, not form. He loved machinery, he loved to see how things were made and problems solved. Every Christensen family vacation included a trip to a local factory, and it was usually Christensen’s favorite part of the trip.</blockquote>

I did this recently, in Italy. I took a trip to Naples for the express purpose of visiting a factory. Not only did it quench my mechanical mind's thirst but the journey itself led to a set of incredible experiences. Understanding the details gives you a different view about how to solve problems in any context.

Second, a great anecdote about a large company (probably McDonald's) who couldn't figure out how to sell more milkshakes. How they approached the question is definitely worth reading. For brevity I'll leave out the why and jump to their conclusion:

<blockquote>“Once you understood what job the customers were trying to get done, how to improve the product became clear: you make the milkshake even more viscous. You stir tiny chunks of fruit into it, not to be healthy, because they didn’t hire it to be healthy, but to make the commute more unpredictable—they’re driving along and—upp!—a lump of fruit. And you move the dispensing machine to the front of the counter and give people a prepaid swipe card so they can just gas up and go.</blockquote>
