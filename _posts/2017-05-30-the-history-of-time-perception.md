Derek Thompson is one of my favorite writers. His work criss-crosses between economics, psychology and marketing in often wild ways.

His piece on <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/a-brief-economic-history-of-time/510566/">the history of the construct and perception of time</a> came out&nbsp;in December and I just got around to reading it this week. And I'm mad I waited.

Like most of Derek's work it's a simple read&nbsp;but full of fascinating detail. Derek's&nbsp;substance to words ratio is always off the charts.

I probably should have known that the use of watches came about en masse because of war and&nbsp;time zones, in fact even the construct of an agreed upon standard time (what minute is it),&nbsp;came from the&nbsp;railroads.

As railroads covered more&nbsp;ground and more people were connecting&nbsp;from one railroad to another, 2pm had to be 2pm otherwise people and freight would miss trains.

<blockquote>Imagine walking through an airport terminal (already logistical chaos) and learning that Delta and United now operate by entirely separate time schedules: A United flight that takes off, on-time, at 1pm leaves at the same time as a Delta flight departing on-time at 2pm, and the clocks on the wall correspond to neither Delta nor United.</blockquote>

Imagining a time when such a thing was not widely accepted is like considering a time when gravity was widely&nbsp;believed to be not a result of a mathematical calculation, but because rocks "wanted&nbsp;to be on the ground."

The piece goes on to discuss our perception of time, specifically how we think about work and leisure.

<blockquote>But those who valued time over money were happier, even when the researchers controlled for income. Among people with similarly high income, those most satisfied with life were far more likely to choose time. As they <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/opinion/sunday/what-should-you-choose-time-or-money.html?_r=0&amp;referer=">wrote</a>, “the value individuals place on these resources relative to each other is predictive of happiness.”</blockquote>

This is really just one of the better things I've read in a long time.
