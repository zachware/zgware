post_title: The Obstacle Is the Way by Ryan Holiday
author: Zach Ware
post_excerpt: "I've been a Ryan Holiday follower for years. This book is his application of stoicism to everyday life, especially for millennials. After reading more Stoic works, I find this book to be very pedestrian. But it serves its purpose and is a great primer in Stoicism for anyone slightly interested in the topic who hasn't read Meditations or Letters from Seneca. "
