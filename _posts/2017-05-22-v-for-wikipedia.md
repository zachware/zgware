After a great week in London working with our investment partners I decided to take a week to putz around Europe. After all, what are airline miles for?

When I travel I like to explore random places and off the beaten path restaurants.

Atlas Obscura once led me to <a href="https://instagram.com/p/BR7Fk7VAmfMsC9DGc88Dx_MNbpz6aL65W8Tads0/">a donkey refuge in Palo Alto</a> that was only a few blocks from my hotel.&nbsp;

I keep long Evernotes about every city I visit to recall or share with others friends who live there and interesting places I want to remember to go to again. I also star a ton of places in Google maps. &nbsp;

One of my favorite new apps for discovering cool places is <a href="http://v-for-wiki.com/">V for Wikipedia</a>. I came across it thanks to Kevin Kelly's weekly <a href="http://recomendo.com/">Recommendo email newslette</a>r.&nbsp;

It shows you Wikipedia entries for things close to you. Or close to a location. And the UI is beautiful.&nbsp;

It's led me to a few interesting places around the ancient city of Pompeii. And it provides a ton of history wherever you are.&nbsp;

It's a paid app and even if you don't travel frequently I highly recommend it.&nbsp;
