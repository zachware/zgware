author: Zach Ware
post_excerpt: "This book gives an incredibly detailed account of the history of Amazon. While some aspects may not be fully accurate due to the non-insider position of the author, just the historical account as seen from the outside is interesting. Many of the major turning points in Amazon's business happened very early when a lot of us weren't paying attention."
