I enjoy observing politics through a behavioral lens. Regardless of the issue the way we do things can be baffling if you can separate yourself from the issues and just observe the behaviors.

Take this (not scientifically valid) sampling of people in the UK.

The way we can make decisions with zero regard for impact is astonishing. We do it everyday. In most cases it is a choice between instant, delayed and deferred gratification. Votes like Brexit are more complex but born from the same behavioral lens.

Once the hypothetical we could not fathom becomes reality and we have the data to objectively measure its impact, we develop regrets.&nbsp;

Regardless of your position on this is an interesting study happening in real-time.&nbsp;
