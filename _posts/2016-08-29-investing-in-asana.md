<em>Here's another <a href="https://zgware.com/c/portfolio-co-emails/">email I sent to our portfolio company</a> leaders last week.</em>

When I checked in last week I failed to include an additional company we've had the pleasure of working with over the past few months.

<strong><a href="http://asana.com/"><strong>Asana</strong></a></strong>
We had an opportunity to join <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2016/03/asana-raising-50m-for-work-tracking/">a highly non-traditional Series C</a> of investors, customers and leaders that Justin (cofounder/CEO) and Dustin (cofounder) assembled earlier this year. The round was led by Sam Altman personally and provided an opportunity for us to more directly support a company that we respect tremendously. <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/asana">See Sam's note</a> here.

A couple of years ago I accidentally stumbled into a talk at Web Summit. Justin was the speaker. His talk led me to skip the final day of Web Summit spending the day in my Airbnb planning how I was going to implement what I learned. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1nvlNaiKvU">This was the talk.</a> It was the genesis for many things, including the events that would lead to our joining as an investor.

To understand my view on Asana you need only spend a few minutes talking about how I architect my work and my life around clarity of purpose, plan and accountability. And there's a high probability I've shared my architecture for communication systems with you. Asana is a critical factor in making the world more contextual and less noisy.

My appreciation for Asana extends well beyond the tool. Its greatest influence on me and how I do things stems from how Justin and team manage their company, their planning processes and their culture.

We continue to be amazed at Asana's progress and their team.

**Note: **For those interested in Asana the product, please feel free to reach out to Shannon who has offered to answer any questions you have. I also highly suggest checking out <a href="https://links5.mixmaxusercontent.com/ZRnWjpWF32gcGmx45/l/BPZaI8LYu9dCDr64Z?messageId=w3W0QiimIm4suEGwp&amp;rn=ISZyF2Vgg2YhplI&amp;re=i02bj5CbhRXawF2YmRndAh2YhpnI">The Guide</a>, which I think is the best customer help resource I've seen in the productivity space.
