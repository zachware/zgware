post_title: Start with Why by Simon Sinek
author: Zach Ware
post_excerpt: "At first glance this book seems like a soft business advice book. It's not. Great companies have a reason to do what they do. Lacking a purpose decisions are hard and inconsistent. Simon's book demonstrates that a clear purpose energizes companies and customers. In short, things are easier. Read this."
