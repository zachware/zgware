<p>I live and work in Austin, TX and part-time in Whitefish, Montana.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is what I’m doing now. This is what I prioritize at the expense of all other demands. <br> <em>in order of time spent, not necessarily priority</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Building Freehouse Capital where we acquire and scale profitable closely-held businesses with heavy physical operations, with no intention to sell.</li><li>Training with <a href="https://www.centralathlete.com">Central Athlete</a> including resistance four days/week + conditioning two days/week. Couple with some yoga, gravel biking and and rowing (<a href="https://www.texasrowingcenter.com">sometimes on the river</a>). Recovering with infrared sauna and cold plunge as much as possible.</li><li>Writing. For myself and <a href="https://zgware.com/mailing-list/" data-type="page" data-id="36414">my mailing list</a>...more to cultivate clarity of thinking than to build a following. </li><li>Building rituals with my close friends to help us stay connected. My rule is to do something with friends every single day.</li><li>Supporting and hustling for the leaders behind my personal investments and VTF Capital’s past venture investments. (Neither VTF Capital nor I are making new investments right now).</li></ul>

<p>This page was inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org">Derek Sivers</a> and his <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff">/now</a>. I had my one of my biggest nerd fanboy moments when I found out I was a testimonial <a href="nownownow.com/about">on his site</a>.</p>
